MScR Project - Stellar rotation formalisms of Î³ Doradus stars from gravity-mode period spacings

(Updated 14/12/2019)

This file contains the source codes (without object files) in mesa-r10398/adipls/adipack.c/adipls,
edited for controlling rotation computation with 2nd order perturbative method through MESA. 

The codes are coupled to the MESA astero src files.

Settings are controlled with the input file inlist_pulse_controls in astero work directories 
(e.g. work_bench_adipls), not the original adipls.c.in or adipls.c.pruned.in. 


For instructions on how to use, please refer to the astero repo README.md
