# adipls

This file contains the source codes (without object files) in mesa-r10398/adipls/adipack.c/adipls,
edited for controlling 2nd order perturbative method computation from MESA. 

The codes are coupled to the MESA astero src files.

Settings are controlled with the input file inlist_pulse_controls in astero work directories 
(e.g. work_bench_adipls), not the original adipls.c.in or adipls.c.pruned.in.
